The versions 2.3.x and 2.4.x are in maintenance mode.

## How to Contribute

Spring Cloud AWS is a community project and we are open for contributions. If you are looking into contributing new feature or integration, ideally start with creating an issue or discussion topic in the GitHub repository. From there we can align on how we believe it should be implemented.

Before you start coding, make sure to get familiar with our contributor guidelines and set up your IDE to follow coding conventions.
